This is a small demonstration of a binary classification project.

It takes 13 features describing the status of a patient and predicts whether a patient has or doesn't have heart disease. 

It uses a stack of models: KNN, Decision trees, Gaussian Process Classifier and MLP as base models, and another MLP as a meta learner model.
